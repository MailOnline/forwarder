forwarder
=========

Monitor log files and forward their content to either stdout or network.

After successfully forward the new content, it saves the offset of the files in the OFFSETS file. So to continue where it left off after a restart.

The network output can be used to send events to [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/)


Why another one?
----------------

Because we needed a tool that could run solely on Python 2.4

Requirement
-----------

- Python >= 2.4


Usage: `sender`
---------------

```
Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f, --follow          Pools the file very second for changes in an infinite
                        loop.
  -p OFFSETS, --offsets=OFFSETS
                        File to persist the last offsets read for each file.
                        If it doesn't exist, the files are read from
                        beginning.
  -t HOST:PORT, --tcp=HOST:PORT
                        Sends the output to the host:port via TCP.
  -s BYTES, --signature-length=BYTES
                        First BYTES of the each file will be used as it's ID
                        in offsets file, so the files can be renamed not
                        losing the offset. Default is 50.
  -g STARTING, --greater-or-equal-than=STARTING
                        Only copy lines which are >= than STARTING in
                        lexicographical order. In lines starting with
                        datetime, this can be used to ignore older events.
  -e, --start-from-the-tail
                        Generate offsets file at the tail of every file.
                        Useful if you want to start following the end of all
                        files returned in pattern. .. Well, ask Fabio.
  -l FILTER, --filter=FILTER
                        Command or shell script that will filter the events
                        using stdin and stdout.
  -r, --retry-on-network-error
                        Keep trying to reconnect instead of exiting with an
                        error.
```

Example
-------

```
$ sender '/service/*/log/current' -p ~/services-offsets -t 10.0.0.1:7878 \
	-r -f -l 'grep --line-buffer -v TRACE' -d 0.5
```

This keep checking every second for changes in all `/service/*/log/current` files and sent its content to the tcp address `10.0.0.1:7878` after it is filtered by `grep --line-buffer -v TRACE`, and it will keep retrying in case of network failure. Also, upon receiving a SIGINT or SIGTERM, stop sending new content to filter and give it half of second to flush it's buffers.


How does it work?
-----------------

Every second `sender` will open all files it monitors that the size is >= than the signature-length, seek to last offset known, and tries to read more bytes. If there is new content, it will send either to stdout or network or the filter.

If a filter has been specified, the new content sent to it, and then the filter's result is gonna be output.

After the new content is successfully sent either to stdout, network or filter, the OFFSETS file is recreated with the last known offsets of each file.

#### Signature

`sender` uses the "signature" instead of filename to identify the file. And the signature is the md5 of the first `signature-length` bytes, which defaults to 50 bytes. This way the file can be renamed (rolled), and it's content won't be output again.

#### Zip Files

Zip files will be open and processed only once. `sender` will unzip them to a temp folder and each file will be recursively processed as if it was a normal file (trying to match it's signature with the persisted OFFSETS file). After all files are processed, the temp folder is removed and a single entry is added to the OFFSETS file for the zip one.


Filters
-------

You can pass filters that will receive new content line by line, and its output will be forwarded instead of the original content.

Examples:

This will remove all lines with TRACE in it from the output
```
$ ./sender /path/to/mylog.log -l 'grep --line-buffer -v TRACE'
```

**Important**: tools like `grep` usually by default flush after every line only if the output is a TTY (user interactive session), and disable it otherwise. For the example uses use the option `--line-buffer` to force grep to flush after every line, so we won't lose the lines kept in its internal buffers in case of a restart.

The argument passed to filter will be run with `sh -c`, which means you can pass any bash script there or chain multiple commands using pipe, like:
```
$ ./sender /path/to/mylog.log -l "grep --line-buffer MY_LOGS | awk '{print \$2}'"
```

Notice the above example escapes the `$`, because we're using double codes for the argument and we want to keep bash from resolving `$2`.


Network Protocol
----------------

Well, this is pretty "protocol-less", in the sense that when forwarding to a tcp address it will just open the connection and output raw traffic in the same way [netcat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) does.
